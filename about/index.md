I started this blog for the following reasons:

* To write what I learn and learn more about what I write.
* To start a habit.
* Being a blog powered by Jekyll and hosted on Openshift, I get to learn a lot just writing a post.
* To share what is happening in my life. (Atleast the stories that I can share).

## I will write about:

* My JavaScript learnings
* User Experience. 
* Personal life.
* Share quotes.
* And things I haven't quiet figured out yet.
